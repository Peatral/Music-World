This folder contains assets from the LG mobile game Music World. The Assets were ripped using a collection of tools, and some assets are available in a few different formats. I've provided an (original) compressed PXO of the game, as well as an uncompressed one (which was done via LGUI https://code.google.com/archive/p/lgui/)

If you are interested in the reverse engineering process, I have written an article on my website that covers how I did it for this game: https://buu342.me/blog/projects/00-MusicWorldRE.html


Music
------------
Music is available in 4 formats:
1) The original MIDI's, ripped directly from the uncompressed PXO using a hex editor
2) The MIDI's in OpenMPT with a reconstruction of the LG Cookie Soundbank. This is currently WIP, as the soundfont isn't 100% accurate yet.
3) The music, recorded from an LG Cookie Fresh, in FLAC format.
4) The same recordings, but in MP3 to reduce file size.

This folder also contains the Soundbank, which was made by William B. Santos. Credit goes to him: http://willbsantos.weebly.com
The Soundbank, like I mentioned, is not 100% accurate and I am slowly reconstructing inaccurate parts.

I've also included a fake cover, which I made from game sprites.

The music is available on YouTube. Link here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLT68gvVjL8uupuZ_zwIgFicDn7h2NHMX2

The music is also archived on khinsider. Link here: https://downloads.khinsider.com/game-soundtracks/album/music-world


Sounds
------------
Sound effects are mostly in WAV format, but 3 of them are in MIDI. These were also ripped manually from the uncompressed PXO by using a hex editor. I have provided those three sounds in OpenMPT format, as well as WAV. Be aware that they use the same inaccurate soundfont as the music, so those 3 MIGHT not be 100% accurate.

The sound effects are also available on Sound's Resource. Link here: https://www.sounds-resource.com/mobile/musicworld/

Sprites
------------
These were ripped using a tool I made from the uncompressed PXO: https://github.com/buu342/PY-Music-World-Sprite-Ripper

They are currently sorted, but unamed and don't have the transparent backgrounds removed (there was no transparency data inside the game's files), so those will have to be cleaned up manually.

Sprite Sheets are availabe on Spriter's Resource. Link here: <TODO>


FAQ
------------
Q: Whoa, this came out of nowhere. Why did you do this?
A: For fun, and for game preservation reasons. You can't play this game anymore unfortunately, so pulling assets is the least that can be done to preserve it.

Q: Will you be doing more stuff related to the game? Like reverse engineering, emulation, etc...
A: Nope. I already have enough big projects on my plate.

Q: What about "World of Tunes"?
A: I probably won't be doing anything with World of Tunes either. I never played it so I don't really have much connection to it, although just like Music World, it is considered lost media... Decisions decisions...
